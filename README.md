This project is part of my journey in the 'Formação AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification', where I am enhancing my skills in Amazon Web Services cloud services. As part of this process, I am exploring the 'Collections-Java-API' module, which allows me to deepen my knowledge of Java and learn how to effectively use the collections API. During the development of this project, I am applying the concepts learned in the module to create a customized solution tailored to my needs.
